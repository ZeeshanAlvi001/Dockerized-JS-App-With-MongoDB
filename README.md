# docker-testapp


This project is a simple Node.js application that connects to a MongoDB database. It processes data stored in JSON format and uses JavaScript for backend logic.

The Node.js app is cloned from a public repository for demonstration purposes.

For the database connection, two Docker containers (Mongo and Mongo-express) are created on the same Docker network, allowing them to communicate locally.

After setting up the containers, I accessed the MongoDB database, made some changes, and verified that the application works as expected.
